            <p class="card-info" >Everybody remembers Osmosis from Biology, but Osmosis is actually part of Chemistry and
                this simple phenomenon is used to produce electricity. If you weren't aware Osmosis is when water moves from a solution of low ion concentration to high ion concentration through a membrane.
                Now the water really really wants to get to the area of high concentration it goes across the membrane to the area of low concentration.
