                which is super broad. It's mostly used to 
                predict how things will act.

                <p class="card-info">When we use physics we're given tons of equations that tell us how something behaves. Physics in Engineering is about using these equations to
                    solve the problem we have.

                    Let's say we have to get this sofa up a flight of stairs which are a 2 meters long and wide enough for the sofa. We say the sofa is 50 kg. Let's say the sofa is a rectangular prism with base 1/4 m^2 and length 1 m^2. 
                    Not we will call our friend to bring up the sofa from the bottom so let's see how heavy it will be from the bottom. Torque, balance bla bla
