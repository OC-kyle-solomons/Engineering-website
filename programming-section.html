            <p>What is Programming?</p>
            <p>Applications in Engineering</p>
            <p>Programming is used to make things move and used for a lot of logic. Programming when it comes to electronics is very specialised and the programs
                are designed specifically for the electronics. Programming is generally used for solving problems
            </p>

            <p>Cheats</p>
            <p>A cool use for programming is to make cheats. Making cheats for real games is hard because of the anti-cheats in place. For real games cheating is all about overcoming the anticheat and is a 
                lot more boring. But for other games with no anticheat you can focus on the cheat itself. Shooter games are very popular and require you to look at a place and shoot an enemy who walks past.
                We can code a script to do this for us. If we think about it logically we have to detect when someone moves past and fire.
